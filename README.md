# SvHttp

SvHttp == Service Virtualized HTTP (for Java)

Design goal - store conversations in Markdown, co-located with the tests that would be using SvHttp 
to isolate themselves from potentially flaky and unquestionably slow remote service.

## OkHttp recorder

Dependable

## UniRest recorder

Has limitations that means that it's not as full featured as the OkHttp recorder (see @Ignore in tests)
